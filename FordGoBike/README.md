### Analyzing Share Bikes
### Introduction
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the San Francisco Bay area.

Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full year’s coverage is desired.

  * Files needed

  * A readme document in plain text (txt), Markdown (md), or PDF form. This document should note the dataset you chose and its source, if it wasn’t part of the Dataset options. It should also report the main findings from your exploratory data analysis and how you chose the plots to put in your explanatory report. If you obtained feedback from others to help your explanatory designs, you should also document that feedback here.
  * A report with your exploratory data analysis. If you use a Jupyter Notebook to conduct your analysis, you should include both the original .ipynb file as well as an html export of the finished notebook.
  * A slide deck with your explanatory analysis. If you use a Jupyter Notebook to create your slide deck, you should include the original .ipynb and the html file generated from nbconvert’s slides conversion.
(Optional) The dataset used to perform your analyses. This won’t be needed if you selected one of the datasets from the Dataset Options document, but you should consider including your dataset if you chose your own. The main reason not to include your dataset is if it is too large to include in the submission. If you can’t include the original data (and even if you can) make your best effort to document the data source in the readme file so that a reviewer can check your work as needed.

### Step 1.3: Explore Your Data
It’s time to get to the interesting bits. Explore your data and document your findings in a report. The report should briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration that you conducted. You should have headers and text that organize your thoughts and findings. Visualizations in this part of the project need not be completely polished: this is just your own exploration at this point. However, you should still make sure that you adhere to principles of using appropriate plot types and encodings so that accurate conclusions can be drawn, and that you have enough comments and labeling so that when you return to your work, you can quickly grasp your analysis steps.

### Step 2.1: Document your Story
At the end of your exploration, you probably have a bunch of things that you’ve discovered. Now it’s time to organize your findings and select a story that you will convey to others. In your readme document, you should summarize your main findings and reflect on the steps you took in your data exploration. You should also lay out the key insights that you want to convey in your explanatory report as well as any changes to visualizations, or note new visualizations that will be created to bridge between your insights.

### Step 2.2: Create your Slide Deck
Follow the plans you laid out in the previous step and create a slide deck with explanatory data visualizations to tell a story about the data you explored. You can start with code that you used in your exploration, but you should make sure that the code is revised so that your plots are polished. Make sure that you also pay attention to aspects of design integrity in your revisions.
